Command-line for Apple Airport
==============================

The executable for Apple Airport is in this location:

	/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport 

To get a pretty nice explanation of what you can do:

	$ airport help

For example, to sniff a chosen channel you do:

	$ sudo airport <interface> sniff <channel>

If *interface* is left out, it will use the first interface on the system,
and it will automatically save any network output to /tmp.
